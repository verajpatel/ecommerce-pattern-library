<h2>Our Egg-celent story</h2>
<p>Before Eggheads became the Eggheads many people know of, it was previously called Yolk for Folk, which started up in 1974 as a black market/small secret shop for eggs alike. The original owner of the company, Alexander E. White, wanted to share the discovery of eggs with the entire world, so he created this company to spread the world of eggs.</p>
